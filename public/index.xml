The high prevalence of the Delta variant in many US states. The trends are likely right but, in most states, the number of sequenced samples is very low, leading to overestimates of the per cent https://www.ft.com/content/7c3a7e3a-6cef-48ae-89a6-01e1a6f15959 by @TWenseleers and http://outbreak.info for N samples
