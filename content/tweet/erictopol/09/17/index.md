It's interesting to watch certain FDA scientists and US public health experts diss or harshly critique waning vaccine effectiveness and 3rd shot data from Israel and the UK when they have no national data of their own

The @PHE_uk and @IsraelMOH carefully track their national data and issue frequent excellent reports, use such data for decisions about vaccine dose-spacing (UK), teens, boosters (IL/UK), etc. The US does not have *national* data for vaccine effectiveness

File under horrific and hard to believe this is happening
There were 3,449 covid deaths in the US reported today, with 1,554 from recent days in Florida

Best product name for a covid vaccine to date?

Unusual in children; increase in women, middle-age, high viral load (Ct). Overall lower % than previous reports

New @CDCMMWR on US vaccinations, antibody (Ab) response, and protection from hospitalization (H)  in non-immunocompromised people, March-August https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm?s_cid=mm7038e1_w
Vaccine Effectiveness vs H:
Moderna 93%, Pfizer 88%, J&amp;J 71%
See Table below for details, Figure for Ab response

Note Pfizer's data after 120 days reduction of vaccine effectiveness vs hospitalization  91% (88-93) to 77% (67-84). That is statistically significant and not trivial.

These US IVY network data and much more (including July/August timing) were not part of today's @US_FDA VRBPAC  and Monday's ACIP Pfizer booster review. That is unfortunate with continued assertions by many that there is fully preserved vaccine protection from hospitalizations

Agree with this call with a qualifier. 
Not "probably."
Age ‚â• 60. There is unequivocal benefit of the 3rd shot. 
Need further data for making the decision on younger age groups. https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1438938594756935689

@davidrlurie Understood. Ultimately, need for a 3rd shot will likely be validated for all vaccines and much broader w/r to age and other features. Just don't have enough data now.

<a href="https://twitter.com/erictopol/status/1438950683957358598" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">19:39 UCT</a>

The vote question was set up to fail, calling for a blanket approval for all age 16+ (related to aggressive Pfizer EUA request). How could that possibly be voted for in favor when such broad data do not exist anywhere?
Of course, the vote was 16 to 3 against.

There will be a new question, likely with the age 60 cutoff, that is likely to get near unanimous support.
(Reminder: The UK went ahead with an age 50 cutoff this week for all vaccines).
Left unaddressed is the vulnerable frontline health care workforce

<a href="https://twitter.com/erictopol/status/1438963127911993345" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">20:28 UCT</a>

Now a unanimous vote in favor of 65 and older and people at high-risk for severe covid (which gives room for interpretation).  OK, that's progress. üëç https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1438950683957358598

All good stuff

A very good outcome for this FDA Advisory Committee following what data are available w/r to age, and recognizing the need for high-risk individuals, due to co-existing conditions or occupational exposures, such as the heathcare workforce, essential workers, and teachers.
