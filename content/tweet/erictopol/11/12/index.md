Oh, cases are "nonsensical"
Even though cases beget cases, beget #LongCovid, were the primary endpoint of efficacy for all vaccination trials, and have tracked with hospitalizations and deaths for every wave and recovery phase of the US pandemic https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/1458947883613437957

Why are we lucky?
‚Äîüíâbecame available faster than any in history by many years
‚ÄîDespite 2 years of considerableü¶†evolution, our vaccines have maintained remarkably high efficacy w/ a 3rd shot
‚Äî&gt;90% efficacy &gt;&gt; 50%, preset criteria for FDA approval 
‚ÄîSafety in billions of people

For months the media &amp; many experts insisted the vaccines were fully protective vs severe disease while the evidence was pointing against that assertion. Still today @nytimes! No wonder the public is confused and  booster uptake is low. Only 32% in the highest risk age group, 65+

The last thing we need now is division among governmental agencies for support of 3rd (booster) shots. While the data for their benefit are overwhelming, the demand so far is weak, especially among high-risk people https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/11/biden-administration-coronavirus-booster-shots/ @lauriemcginley2 @bylenasun @tylerpager

What is the principal reason for Europe's surge?
Insufficient vaccination/immunity

Why does this portend trouble for the US?
Our vaccination rate is 58.5%, considerably less than countries that are surging in the EU, and our counter to waning with 3rd shots is moving very slowly

Colorado and California broadening eligibility for boosters (3rd shots) for all adults. 
6 months after mRNA, 2 months after J&amp;J
Good. That's what the data supports to fully restore vaccine effectiveness to &gt;90%
