The US Delta wave, 10 August
Now nearly 74,000 patients hospitalized, which is a ~5X increase in 5 weeks, towering well above the 1st 2 waves, when vaccines were just a fantasy
1,238 deaths 
158,000 new cases
Devastating, and even more so knowing how so much was preventable

@danieloran @PNASNews @Pratha_Sah @Alison_Galvani @MeaganCFitz @YaleSPH @YCIDMA Kudos to @danieloran, who nailed this over a year ago. We got a lot of flak for estimating it was 35%. After 350 studies now, his hard work has been validated

@apoorva_nyc ‚ÄúThe vaccines were designed to prevent severe illness, not infection.‚Äù
All of the clinical trials which validated the vaccines had prevention of symptomatic infections as their primary endpoint.

Risk for breakthrough infection is 9-fold for unvaccinated
‚ÄîThe risk of an infection among fully vaccinated has increased 4.5-fold from 1 (pre-Delta) to 4.5 per 100,000 people
‚ÄîThe absolute and relative benefit of vaccination has markedly increased during the Delta wave

Delta wave data in the US is hard to come by.
Here is the latest from San Diego County @SDCountyHHSA 
‚ÄîUnvaccinated 50:1 odds for hospitalization
‚ÄîThe absolute rate has gone up for vaccinated with Delta
‚ÄîBut far more for unvaccinated
‚ÄîRelative risk for unvaccinated has soared

These data (and much more) are collected for every patient admitted for covid hospitalization in the United States. It is unacceptable that they are not tracked  nationally and made available on a daily basis

Delta breakthrough infections among 62 healthcare workers vaccinated in Vietnam
1. High viral loads. Many asymptomatic infections with similar viral loads
2. Low neutralizing antibodies
3. Transmission between vaccinated individuals

There needs to be truth-telling about the reduced protection of mRNA vaccines vs symptomatic Delta infections. 
It was 95% pre-Delta. 
Many are claiming it's still ~80%.
It isn't. 
50-60% is best estimate from all sources (not US, since we don't have the data)

Why is this important?
Because we need to protect the protected, the fully vaccinated.
Sure we want to get more people vaccinated, but truth engenders trust. And truth helps guide people to be safe, use masks, distance, ventilation and all the other tools we have and know helps.

Look at Israel's Delta case surge, a model country for vaccination, &gt;15 per cent points more of total population vaccinated than the US. That, in itself, tells us about the reduction of protection of mRNA vaccines vs cases/spread

@NateSilver538 Agree there's a lot of uncertainty, Nate. But without that certainty, continued assertions of very high protection are unhelpful. We would know precisely what the level of protection vs symptomatic infections was if we collected the data and did the proper studies

@leonidkruglyak @antonioregalado REACT is the best study, Leonid, including random sampling and the range of asymptomatic/mild to symptomatic infections of 49-60%, including mRNA. Israel's data are now less that that. What is your estimate?



---

<a href="https://twitter.com/erictopol/status/1425510556497108994" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">17:32 UCT</a>

I stand by my estimate, which includes soon to be published preprints with US data even lower than this range.
But the protection vs hospitalization and death is solid, holding up well, and is the reason why everyone should be vaccinated

REACT upper range 60%, includes mRNA
Israel currently lower
I'll send you a preprint to review that'll post soon

@NuritBaytch That's right. Not at all confident about this big gap vs Moderna with the matching methodology used. But it is a replication of the Israeli (Pfizer) data of ~40% and it is time to stop denying the reduction in protection vs symptomatic infections with Delta
