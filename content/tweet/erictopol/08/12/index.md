Simplified table of the 5 reported studies for 2-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness vs Delta infections. The Mayo &amp; Qatar studies did not account for time from vaccination (Pfizer longer duration). Infection definitions vary.  UK data: 8-12 wks btwn doses, others 3 wks

Hospitalizations.
Already ~60% of peak pandemic.
Beyond twice the normalized peak of the Delta waves in UK and Israel.

@FerreiraVHF Great study! And to show the value of the placebo arm here, too. And the same day that the FDA approved boosters for immunocompromised, another reflection of your work üôè https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/us/politics/third-vaccine-dose-approval.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage by @SharonLNYT @noahweiland

The diagnosis and denial of waning immunity from Delta infections (*does not pertain to hospitalizations or deaths*)
In July, @IsraelMOH issued a report that showed a marked decline in mRNA vaccine (@Pfizer) protection vs Delta infections, down to 40%. That was met with disbelief

There are now 5 mRNA vaccine effectiveness studies for preventing Delta infections, and more on the way. Except for @PHE_UK, all show a marked reduction, particularly for @Pfizer, but the @moderna_tx comparison is confounded by its later administration (less chance to see waning)

This reduction of protection is quite different from the 6-month follow up of the Pfizer and Moderna pivotal trials which showed modest decline, but were against the original strain, not Delta

This vulnerability to infections appears to be driven by time since vaccine, such as seen in this Israeli analysis. The age trend is noted, not statistically significant

Which brings me to the outlier @PHE_UK report which suggests there was preserved VE for Pfizer.  Again we  don't know the time from vaccination which may have been shorter. The longer spacing, up to 12 weeks, may have induced a stronger immune response.

<a href="https://twitter.com/erictopol/status/1425798878327050242" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">12:38 UCT</a>

Why the differences between Pfizer and Moderna?
They are likely considerably less and skewed due to longer time from Pfizer vaccine, not accounted for in the studies. But there may still be a gap, with the higher relative dose and slightly (1 week) longer spacing



---

<a href="https://twitter.com/erictopol/status/1425798884131934209" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">12:38 UCT</a>

Bottom line: There is clearcut evidence of waning immunity for mRNA vaccines vs Delta infections, pronounced with Pfizer, but very likely affecting Moderna too. My estimate yesterday of 50-60% was likely optimistic as we get beyond 6 months + more exposure.

The data for neutralizing antibody titer decline and its association with risk of Delta infection has become clear from multiple studies, such as the Vietnam report in healthcare workers with infections https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3897733

@mugecevik @danieloran @PNASNews @Pratha_Sah @Alison_Galvani @MeaganCFitz @YaleSPH @YCIDMA @nicolamlow @BogochIsaac No. To set the record straight, we published at least one-third, which is fully aligned with the @YaleSPH comprehensive review.

@apoorva_nyc If the vaccines were ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù to protect against severe illness, that should have been the primary endpoint of the pivotal clinical trials, but it wasn‚Äôt. They were woefully underpowered to detect an impact an severe illness, which is why we wrote the @nytopinion piece.

These findings are important regarding the consideration for boosters. Health care workers and older individuals  are the people most likely to now be &gt;5-6 months out from vaccination and are at increased risk for Delta infections

@mugecevik @danieloran @PNASNews @Pratha_Sah @Alison_Galvani @MeaganCFitz @YaleSPH @YCIDMA @nicolamlow @BogochIsaac Maybe you need to read that paper:
"the asymptomatic infection rate may be as high as 40% to 45%. A conservative estimate would be 30% or higher to account for the presymptomatic admixture that has thus far not been adequately quantified."

@notdred Wrong. My purpose was to shed light on the problem that has not been adequately acknowledged with considerable new data and more that is about to show up. I have previously written about the lack of data supporting boosters and wish they wouldn't be necessary.

We often tag @justsaysinmice when a report is only conducted in mice, not people.
We need #justsayitsDelta or not for covid findings. 
Pre-D posts are not particularly helpful unless it's for comparison sake.
