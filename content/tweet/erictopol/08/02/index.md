US 4th, Delta wave
Hospitalizations are now &gt;49,000, highest since February,  rising rapidly, and clearly will surpass waves 1 and 2.
It's not too late to double down on all the things we know worküíâ,üò∑, distancing, rapid tests to limit the hit

In the states most severely affected by Delta (per capita), there's some signs of slowing of case growth, especially in Missouri and Arkansas, the initial epicenter

Indonesia, the 4th largest population in the world, has been devastated by the Delta variant, with only 8% of its population fully vaccinated

@aaronecarroll @megtirrell The graph came from the @Sdut, Michelle is the graphic artist who plotted the data from San Diego County, which tracks vaccination status with all testing. I noted its importance, made the photo, purposely put her name at the bottom, and posted it

Current US test positivity is 8%; we have not seen &gt;20% levels anytime since the 3rd wave, but now Alabama 22%, Oklahoma 22%, Mississippi 20%, Florida 19% and 20 states in double digits. And grossly under-testing in face of Delta's spread.

It's not just about vaccines and masks. We need far better testing, and freely available rapid home antigen tests, to counter Delta https://news.bloomberglaw.com/pharma-and-life-sciences/frequent-covid-tests-urged-to-help-curb-spread-of-delta-variant w/ @CarlosdelRio7

San Diego County, the 2nd largest in California, fortunately @SDCountyHHSA tracks infections by vaccination status. In July they're all Delta, fewer in the past week. The odds are now 15:1. The Delta wave has markedly increased the benefit of fully vaccinated status vs infections

Notice something different about the rate of rise in this wave for each of the heavily hit states

@davezatz Prior covid + 1-dose vaccine, when assessed, has had a superior immune response than prior covid alone or 2-doses of vaccine. 
Reinfection with Delta hasn't been prominent, based upon the UK data, but still being tracked via SIREN study
