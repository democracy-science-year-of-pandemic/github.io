Why does Michigan, which has a considerably lower vaccination rate than the New England states (shown here), have one of the lowest US case rates (= Vermont, 20/100,000) and hospitalization rates (11/100K)?
Prior covid immunity from its hard-hit Alpha wave may be playing a role.

Hospitalizations in 8 states, &gt;250 hospitals, during the US Delta wave
"For June 27 - July 24, hospitalization rates were ≥10 times higher in unvaccinated persons compared with vaccinated persons for all age groups across all weeks"

"This brings vaccine efficacy for booster-vaccinated individuals to ~95%, similar to the original "fresh" vaccine efficacy reported agains the Alpha strain"

"For people with &gt;12-days lag btwn the booster vaxx &amp;severe illness...decreased relative risk of severe disease 15.5 fold"

The preliminary findings from Israel today of the booster &gt;10-fold reduction of severe illness aligns with the what has been established for primary vaccination efficacy and neutralizing level antibodies https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1413925899443916800

Here are the Pfizer neutralizing antibody results from a 306 participant study of their booster (otherwise unpublished to date), &gt;3 times the levels of 2nd dose response, with 1 month follow-up (median follow-up time 2.6 months)

@Samooner There's remarkable potential for a near universal, pan-coronavirus vaccine, but we need to make that #1 priority

Initial impressions from a couple of weeks ago still hold, with more pronounced impact on protection from severe illness than projected (if today's @IsraelMOH report in age &gt; 60 extends over follow-up time and across all age groups) https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1427632692158468107
