How many people get Covid from being in the hospital?
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01786-4/fulltext @TheLancet 
 "We estimate that 11.3%... of patients with COVID-19 in 314 UK hospitals became infected after hospital admission; and ... 6.8% ...of all patients with COVID-19 had nosocomial infections"

@AndrewJLowry No.  The country of Georgia is 6%

Why is this graph so concerning?
We're double the Delta wave peak of UK and Israel in hospitalizations and show no sign of letting up.
We'll hit 80,000 today and if we don't get slowing we'll exceed the 3rd wave peak of 125,000.
Never thought this would be possible with ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰

@DavidAmoyal Yes, the country, not the state

The Delta waves in the US and Canada, a striking contrast. Fully vaccinated of total population:
Canada 64%
US 50%

Infections are 98% Delta in the US now.
This very formidable strain of the virus quickly achieved a full replacement for Alpha throughout the world, reflecting its extraordinary contagiousness and some immune evasiveness (&lt;-less than Beta).

The situation in Israel
775,000 people have received 3rd shot boosters, now approved for age &gt;50, health care workers
1st country to get going, unexpectedly --&gt; waning immunity/Delta combo
And the 3 week spacing of the 2 doses likely inferior to 8-12 weeks

These are the kind of data that need to be communicated to the public, as tracked by Oregon 
Yes, with Delta the breakthrough cases have increased but the benefit of vaccination has gone up markedly

The latest data from San Diego County, another place where this is tracked, along with hospitalizationsâ€”which have remained quite low despite the increase in breakthroughs. The same augmented benefit of vaccination in the Delta wave is readily apparent.

There are &gt;80,000 hospitalized covid patients in the US today. 
We need to know vaccination status, time from vaccine, which vaccine, age, comorbidities, at a minimum. 
Every day. Posted for all.
All these data are captured in EHRs, just not aggregated.

@marsbeyond This graph is for hospitalizations, not cases.

Impressive and a glimpse into the future. Sequencing #SARSCoV2 in hospitals rapidly identified 2 cases of B.1.621, community transmission in the UK, when 99% of cases were Delta. Done in &lt;24 hrs, instead of 10 days https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00482-5/fulltext

@donmacleod20 The posts you refer to were about breakthrough infections, NOT hospitalizations
