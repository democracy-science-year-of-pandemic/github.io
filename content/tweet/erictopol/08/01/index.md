How to build a Delta immunity wall.
The state with lowest rate of hospitalizations in the US Delta wave is the one with the highest vaccination (67% of 650,000 population).  
3 covid patients in the whole state of Vermont, 1 in ICU, past 2 weeks here

How do hospitalizations compare for Delta infections without vaccination?
Instead of 1.2/1000 above, if we use most recent @PHE_uk data, 16/1000 overall (&gt;10X)
11/1000 for age &lt;50
58/1000 for age â‰¥50

@ScottGottliebMD These data are highly encouraging, Scott, but they donâ€™t reflect or partition Delta, with a clearcut higher breakthrough infection liability. The CDCâ€™s May 1st decision to stop tracking breakthroughs, unless hospitalized, was a significant misstep

Where was the pressure months ago?
The mandates have been proceeding despite FDA's lack of full approval, but would have occurred sooner and been more widespread had that review been completed

On May 1 @CDCgov stopped tracking breakthrough infections unless hospitalized. That was a mistake then, but with the increased risk posed by Delta, it's more serious. Complete tracking needs to be reinstated, w/ demographics, PCR Ct results, samples for neutralizing antibodies...

August 1
Florida is adding 400-600 new hospitalized patients per day, ~90 in ICU. If this continues, it's less than a week away from highest in its pandemic.
In the post-vaccination era......

Delta is daunting: one of the highest % vaccinated in the US, San Francisco
â€”Most breakthroughs mild/moderate Sx ; ~1% requiring hospitalizations is in keeping w/ other reports
â€”All healthcare staff must be vaccinated
â€”Our tracking for these is woeful

If you thought the UK's Delta wave was bad, we've got a much worse situation brewing in multiple places, led by LA and FL http://outbreak.info

Footnotes
1. These are San Diego County data where infections are tracked by vaccination status and has one of the highest sequencing rates of samples in the US
2. The benefit of vaccination for protection vs infections has grown substantially during the Delta wave
