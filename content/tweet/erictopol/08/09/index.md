A picture that denotes the absence of a national strategy, of states rolling on their own, with leaders unwilling to adopt best practices for defending vs Delta, and which puts the whole country in jeopardy of further spread

@MinorLeagueBall Agree. I meant implementing a united, consistent national strategy against this formidable version of the virus, our common enemy

I wrote about the implications of the breakdown at @CDCgov for not tracking breakthrough infections during the Delta wave @guardian

The graph that concerns me most about the US Delta wave. Independent of our profound testing deficit. Hoping for imminent flattening and bending of this curve

Yes, it's worst in states with the lowest vaccination rates.  And largely driven by them. But no state is exempt from being part of the increase

@JamesSurowiecki You're spot on here, James. I would just add that we have no idea what per cent of these hospitalizations are in unvaccinated people, which is a big miss to follow/understand what is really going on.

Another way is to look at the rate of rise as compared with Waves 1-3, pre-vaccination. 
From 15,000 to 67,000 in 5 weeks

This is quite misleading by admixing all the pre-Delta data when breakthrough infections were rare. I only wish it was true.

More data on the diminished immune response to the Delta variant in vaccinated people on immunosuppression drugs, supporting their need for a booster

These CDC travel advisories are amusing. Specifying countries testing up to 5X more than the US as high risk.
How about domestic travel advisories?

This is the first look as to whether booster shots are working in people &gt; 60 years old to suppress infections. Encouraging. Preliminary. https://twitter.com/erlichya/status/1424857057149263873
