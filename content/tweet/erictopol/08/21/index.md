While the debate about boosters ensues, the imminent FDA full approval will usher in millions of prescriptions by doctors for them

How many of the recent increase of US vaccinations to &gt; 1 million/day were 3rd shots, but not properly tracked?

Throughout the pandemic, these states have tracked closely together (with the exception of the Mardi Gras superspreader). In the Delta wave, they are all still on the rise for new cases

We're very fortunate that #SARSCoV2 monoclonal antibodies are holding up so well against even the most immune evasive variant, Beta (B.1.351)

In the coming weeks, we'll turn the corner on the US Delta wave. But that doesn't mean we'll drop back to baseline. A full court press is needed to build a much stronger immunity wall

This is a phenomenal accomplishment. Just think what it could have been without resistance to the most impressive biomedical triumph in history.

Why do 2 states with almost the same 50% vaccination have such remarkably divergent curves for cases and hospitalizations, with Michigan being one of the lowest in the country?
Supports the impact of natural infection immunity from the Alpha wave in Michigan

It's about time a direct counter-offensive to vaccine misinformation appeared. Good on @RWalensky, taking it on

@yaneerbaryam Thanks, Captain Obvious.
No one predicted this ability of Delta to override vaccinations, to this extent, in these countries. Simply adds to how formidable a challenge it has turned out to reckon with.

Let me make this clear.
Israel got to zero covid and is a model country for vaccination.
The US, unlike Israel and the UK that suppressed 75% of hospitalizations during their Delta wave (vs Alpha), is &gt;75% of its peak.
Findings that reinforce has formidable Delta is to deal with.
