Only 1.8% of the kids had symptoms at 56 days.
That doesn't mean they won't fully resolve subsequently.
It's too bad that even encouraging new data is so poorly received

This report is not addressing whether children should or should not be vaccinated; that's a very different consideration (e.g. risk of transmission). It simply suggests that the potential for #LongCovid in children exists but fortunately is low.

Hospitalizations in the US Delta, 4th wave are close to the peak of waves 1 and 2, and cases &gt;145/000 in a day with limited testing. The only reassuring data relates to low fatalities (so far), reflecting vaccinations and the disease shift to young https://newsnodes.com/us

Good question: Why is #SARSCoV2 prone to superspreading, following the Pareto 80-20 rule for over-dispersion of infections, but not H1N1 or other pathogens?

A large UK study of vaccination protection from Delta symptomatic breakthrough infections found effectiveness of ~60%  (combines AZ and Pfizer vaccines)

Link to the preprint
https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/90800/2/react1_r13_final_preprint_final.pdf
Extensive PCR testing showed that fully vaccinated people had lower viral loads than un- or partially vaccinated, supporting decreased potential for Delta transmission

The most rigorous assessment to date for Delta breakthroughs, w/ random sampling. The previous @PHE_uk estimate for vaccine effectiveness vs Delta was 88% for Pfizer, 60% for AZ. Israel's (Pfizer) was 60%, likely accurate. No wonder why we're seeing the increase in breakthroughs

The FDA full approval of vaccines in now expected by Labor Day; it took months to get transparency and communication w/ the public
https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/02/coronavirus-vaccines-fda-full-approval-timeline/
This Q&amp;A shows the prior lack of understanding of its urgency; also the implications on boosters

I applaud the transparency, making it #1 priority.
 It's a shame this wasn't the policy months ago, pre-Delta, when it would have had huge impact

Summary Delta breakthrough studies, Ct/viral load,  vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
Only 1 large study of Ct/viral load, shows some vaccine reduction 
VE ranges 39-88%; it's likely ‚â§ 60% at best for mRNA
More data needed, but points to need for boosters for at least some people

Overall, these findings certainly are concordant w/ increased Delta breakthrough symptomatic infections we're seeing and a major decline in protection (~95% w/ mRNA) compared with previous strains, as reviewed here https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1422644921740136456

Recall that 1-dose mRNA or AZ had little (30%) efficacy (1st study in Table). All of this reflects Delta's immune evasiveness. We're very lucky it's holding up for reduction of hospitalizations/deaths but thisü¶†is far more formidable for both transmission and our immune response

@dvir_a I am well aware of that. That's the denominator used to assess VE. I can only fit so much into 1 tweet

There's little good news for the US Delta wave, but we may be seeing the peak case growth rate for the top 2 states, Louisiana and Florida

Other implications for the VE drop vs infections. 
For awhile we wondered if the mRNA dosing schedule is Israel (3 weeks) vs UK (8-12 weeks) could account for 39-60% vs 88%, respectively. The new UK study doesn't break down vaccine %, but makes this explanation less likely

A better way to see the slowing of case growth is via the log plot, and it looks pretty consistent across the top states

In the pandemic, immunocompromised people (~3% of Americans) are not getting adequate recognition for the potential of in-host evolution of the virus (highlighted studies) and the need for far better approaches to protect them https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2104756?query=featured_home @NEJM

This is a 1st in 2 ways
1. Use of a sub-Q (under the skin) injection rather than an intravenous infusion of the antibodies; the requirement for an IV infusion had led to reduced use for treatment
2. *Preventing* covid after exposure üëç

Notable: several countries with Delta waves had abrupt U-turns that were short-lived or are stuttering

During the 3rd wave in the USA, cases got above 300,000 per day and deaths above 4,000.
In the 4th, Delta wave, cases have already reached ~150,000 in a day, with deaths  ~400 (7-day avg)
[and yes, there's a lag; hospitalizations and #LongCovid are a big deal in this wave]
