I spoke to my colleagues in New Zealand today @AucklandUni.  Not a single community transmission &gt;120 days. No Delta. Envious.

A positive outlier cf many countries who achieved containment thru 2020 but now under Delta pressure
(S Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, others)

The Delta variant impact in Arkansas  (US leading edge)  is resembling that of the UK's more with each passing day. 
Cases/100,000 here. Similar pattern for hospitalizations and deaths, too.

Just published @Nature 
Discovery of a pan-sarbecovirus antibody (S2H97) with implications for both prevention/treatment and a vaccine that would be effective against #SARSCoV2 future variants, preempting immune escape

Mix and match vaccines? 
2 doses AZ vs AZ and then Pfizer:
"BNT162b2 induced significantly higher frequencies of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and, in particular, high titers of neutralizing antibodies against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants"

The implications of the new report are notable. Whereas there were concerns previously about mixing doses of different vaccines, these results support important advantages for protection. 
One caveat is that the people who were studied were healthy, young HCWs

The Delta rise in new cases is now diffuse throughout the US.
But states with the highest vaccination rates also happen to have the lowest hospitalizations in the country
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html
(Arkansas|Missouri, 2 of the lowest vaccination % , are 17 and 20 per 100,000 people)

The Delta deluge, likely coming to a country near you.
The UK crosses the 40,000 new case mark today 
(42,302) 
Were it not for vaccine protection, blunting the toll of severe illness, this would be a far worse situation

Is AR a bellwether for Delta in the US?
Sharp increases in both places with corresponding rise in hospitalizations and deaths, both to lesser levels than in prior surges. Time in Delta dominant much less in AR

98.3% of people hospitalized were unvaccinated

Not a good sign when the largest county in the United States, with above average vaccination, is demonstrating a significant Delta hit. 
Over 99% of hospitalizations are in unvaccinated individuals.

With Canada vaccinating 1.2% of their population each day, and US &lt;0.2%, they will exceed US fully vaccinated in the next 2 days. 
1st dose, total population: Canada 70% vs US 55%

Like the @Nature report below, significantly higher neutralizing antibody levels for AZ + Moderna compared with 2 doses AZ , and better protection vs the Beta (B.1.351) variant

That is Los Angeles.
This is Florida, which is at average levels of vaccination for the country, but experiencing a rapid rise in cases (today &gt;6,400) and hospitalizations https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/florida-covid-cases.html

The term "breakthrough" is not good for post-vaccine infections, most of which are without symptoms or mild.

But is does apply well to what Delta is doing in many parts of the US right now, and it's still early.  Breaking through an insufficient Delta immunity wall.

This is long overdue. @PeterHotez has been leading a counter-offensive to disinformation on a daily basis. We both have been pleading US gov't officials for months to move aggressively on this. Finally 🙏 https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1415348599567831043
