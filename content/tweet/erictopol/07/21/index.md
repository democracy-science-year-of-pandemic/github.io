It has been over 7 months since the US vaccination campaign began. Yet TV and newspaper articles incessantly show people getting needles into their arms. I think we know what that looks like now. Enough

@AstroKatie @grundil I wonder how many people even watched their own inoculation, Katie.  No less to watch others non-stop

The initial aggressive US vaccination rollout, with up to 4.5 million shots per day, essentially squashed the Alpha variant in its tracks, giving the sense the pandemic end was near. 
Little did we know that Delta would be the real Alpha of #SARSCoV2

Proxy for vax efficacy?
"A neut [neutralizing antibody] level that keeps us safe from Alpha wonâ€™t necessarily thwart Beta or Delta to the same extent. (Thereâ€™s at least good news on T cells, which are much harder to stump with mutations)"

Deaths and Delta
Like hospitalizations in the US, they are up &gt;40% in the past 2 weeks, while cases are up 200% https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html?name=styln-coronavirus-live&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=LegacyCollection&variant=1_Show&is_new=false
The relative values don't convey the remarkable vaccine impact here and in UK, Portugal w/ higher, longer Delta hit ðŸ‘‡

We're several weeks behind those countries. This log plot showing replication of UK and Portugal is notable for where we are headed. Nearly all these deaths are among unvaccinated people and are preventable.

 ~5% of &gt;28,000 healthcare workers with mild symptoms, 0.29% led to hospitalization, no deaths; they were 83% suppressed by AZ and Bharat Biotech vaccines

@matthewherper @PamBelluck @BySheilaKaplan @RebeccaDRobbins Kudos to @statnews for breaking this important story and @nytimes for staying on it. In my view, the nadir I have seen for FDA in over 3 decades

This is an encouraging finding from a well regarded group of researchers. The lack of respectful responses is noteworthy and so is the discounting of anything positive by many

@chrislhayes Yes, but....
Would have helped a lot more before Delta reached &gt;85% there

Good thread on some of the data we've been hearing about (but not seeing) on the potential of "waning immunity" for people who got vaccinated early in the Israeli campaign. They also happened to be the most vulnerable. 
Still many uncertainties. https://twitter.com/Nadav_Eyal/status/1417923435737534467
