In contrast, the US has only posted such data once, now 2 months outdated, and represent only ~30% of the country

If the US ever produced and published an up-to-date, informative report, it would be a real breakthrough

The case for not recognizing Prior Covid plus a vaccine (hybrid immunity) as equivalent to fully vaccinated is indefensible. Many countries have made that their health policy, but not the US. @ThalinCharlotte is on it @nytopinion https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/opinion/covid-vaccine-hybrid-natural-immunity.html

A new, rigorous and important study of Covid transmission‚Äîwith or without prior vaccination‚Äîin 621 people with mild infections
Just published @TheLancetInfDis 
https://www.thelancet.com/lancet/article/s1473309921006484
Vaccination reduced spread, but it still occurred in household contacts (unvaxx 38%, vaxx 25%)

Viral load was assessed from 8145 respiratory tract samples for up to 20 days, irrespective of symptoms

The peak load (Delta variant) was similar for unvaccinated vs vaccinated cases, but faster clearance in the latter

All breakthrough cases were mild

From the accompanying editorial
https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/s1473309921006903.pdf
‚ÄúThis study unfortunately also highlights that the vaccine effect on reducing transmission is minimal in the context of Delta variant circulation‚Äù

India peaked in May with its Delta wave (the initial one in the world) and has since been steady and back to baseline for months.
52% of the population has now had at least one dose of vaccine. Extensive prior Covid.
If this holds over time, it's a good sign.

When you have very limited data, nearly 2 months old, you can keep analyzing the same dataset (while the Delta wave didn't stop on Sept 4th)
