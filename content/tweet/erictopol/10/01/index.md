Such data has been remarkably hard to come by and these findings are certainly encouraging

@AndrewMcGIsMe @DrChrisMD Well said. So sorry for the loss of your father, @DrChrisMD. He had to have been immensely proud of you.

This could turn out to be one of the most important advances to counter Covid. Molnupiravir, a pill for 5 days (I'll nickname "M-pack") to markedly reduce hospitalization. Await details beyond press release, including safety

Molnupiravir is a broad spectrum anti-viral that achieves "lethal mutagenesis" of #SARSCoV2. Unlike remdesivir, it's a pill, it's not repurposed, had solid data from a Phase 2 trial supporting potency + safety vs Covid https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-021-00657-8 @nature The mechanism of action ðŸ‘‡

The fact that the new clinical trial was stopped by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board early because of overwhelming efficacy, deeming it unethical to proceed, would be considered a Eureka moment in the fight against Covid

A few additional points
â€”Entry criteria mild to moderate Covid
â€”8 deaths in the placebo group, 0 w/ M-pack
â€”Efficacy seen across multiple variants, including Delta
â€”I have a long history vs Merck (Vioxx) w/ a bias against this company (drug was made by Ridgeback Biotherapuetics)

"Notably, a significant proportion of vaccinees have neutralizing titers below the detection limit, and suggest a 3rd booster immunization might be warranted to enhance the antibody titers and T cell responses."

Compare this with intravenous monoclonal antibodies in Phase 3 trial @NEJM this wk, a 71% reduction (4.6% vs 1.3%) hospitalization/death for outpatients w/ Covid &lt; 7 days from symptom onset. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108163?query=featured_home

Today's news about what appears to be a highly effective pill is welcome, to add to the anti-Covid armamentarium. What is missing, big, and for a long time, is this, and it needs to/can get fixed STAT:

It is outrageous that Merck is charging the government $700 per 5-pill pack of this drug. And that the US has not negotiated it down to a fair price.

Clarification regarding term "reduction"
Data in above post are adjusted odds ratios (aOR)
Alpha: Pfizer 62%, AZ 38% reduction (R)
Delta:  Pfizer 37%, AZ 15%  reduction
Thanks @JamesWard73, pointing out the difference (aOR v R)when the base probability of infection isn't very low
