Why was Israel's 4th, Delta wave such an outlier?
Contributing factors
â€”Vaccine waning, 1st mover disadvantage
â€”Delta's hyper-contagiousness
â€” ~37% of total population unvaccinated 
â€”Short dose spacing (3 wks) -&gt; less memory B &amp; T cells
â€” Lower dose mRNA (30 Âµg vs Moderna 100 Âµg)

@JamesSurowiecki Agree on kids. I think they had ~60% fully vaccinated when Delta hit in late June

Getting everyone age 60+ vaccinated is mission critical.
Many countries and US states have done that well; many are lagging

The importance of age can't be emphasized enough
https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/covid-19-vaccine-status-age-discrimination.html by @dwallacewells @NYMag 
"To put it more bluntly: in assessing an individualâ€™s risk of dying from COVID, age appears still as important â€” and maybe even more important â€” than vaccination status."

A universal sarbecovirus vaccine. We should be all over this, but we're not. It needs to get top priority and for there to be a global collaborative effort. https://www.wsj.com/articles/to-prevent-the-next-pandemic-scientists-seek-one-vaccine-for-many-coronaviruses-11633339802?st=rympt75tje1xzoh&reflink=article_email_share by @betswrites

@HelenBranswell @DLeonhardt I'm an eternal optimist, Helen, so yes, with the hedge that there's not a worse than Delta out there to take its place. Also superstitious, so I wouldn't have written it or jinxed it ðŸ˜‰

Sound familiar, USA?

How often is Covid testing needed to help reduce Delta variant transmission?
Not once per week. Not twice per week.
At least every other day.
With rapid turnaround time.

That decline for Delta was from 93 -&gt; 53% after 4 months.

Vaccine effectiveness vs hospitalization for Delta infections was highâ€” 93% [95% CI 84,96] â€”at a mean time of 3.4 months from being fully vaccinated
