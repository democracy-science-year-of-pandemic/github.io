Something to keep an eye on
The sharp descent in California has stalled. No further decline in hospitalizations over a couple of weeks, with an increase for age 70+, and test positivity which got below 2% is now back up &gt;3%

Not once in 2021 for the pandemic has @WhiteHouse @POTUS @WHCOVIDResponse @HHSGov @SecBecerra announced intent to address/fix the serious data deficiency issues. We've had 1 incomplete (30% of population) Sept 4th shot. 100% can be mandated. But obviously this is not a priority.

Disconcerting to see many countries in Europe starting to heat up again, possibly reflecting, at least in part, some waning of vaccine effectiveness

@JamesSurowiecki Good point, James. Many possible factors besides waning including kids, less mitigation, the residual unvaccinated population, etc.

Bottom line: "natural immunity" is unreliable, provides relatively protection on its own compared with vaccination.
But Prior Covid + 1 dose ("hybrid immunity") vaccine provides better protection than any 2-dose vaccine combo, which a large body of data supports.
