Why is this graph so concerning?
We're double the Delta wave peak of UK and Israel in hospitalizations and show no sign of letting up.
We'll hit 80,000 today and if we don't get slowing we'll exceed the 3rd wave peak of 125,000.
Never thought this would be possible with ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰

The Delta waves in the US and Canada, a striking contrast. Fully vaccinated of total population:
Canada 64%
US 50%

Infections are 98% Delta in the US now.
This very formidable strain of the virus quickly achieved a full replacement for Alpha throughout the world, reflecting its extraordinary contagiousness and some immune evasiveness (&lt;-less than Beta).

The situation in Israel
775,000 people have received 3rd shot boosters, now approved for age &gt;50, health care workers
1st country to get going, unexpectedly --&gt; waning immunity/Delta combo
And the 3 week spacing of the 2 doses likely inferior to 8-12 weeks

These are the kind of data that need to be communicated to the public, as tracked by Oregon 
Yes, with Delta the breakthrough cases have increased but the benefit of vaccination has gone up markedly

There are &gt;80,000 hospitalized covid patients in the US today. 
We need to know vaccination status, time from vaccine, which vaccine, age, comorbidities, at a minimum. 
Every day. Posted for all.
All these data are captured in EHRs, just not aggregated.

Impressive and a glimpse into the future. Sequencing #SARSCoV2 in hospitals rapidly identified 2 cases of B.1.621, community transmission in the UK, when 99% of cases were Delta. Done in &lt;24 hrs, instead of 10 days https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00482-5/fulltext

US Delta-induced hospitalizations today, ~81,200, adding ~2,000 each day
In the UK and Israel, high rates of vaccination were associated with a ~75% reduction of hospitalizations compared to their Alpha wave. No sign of that here.
