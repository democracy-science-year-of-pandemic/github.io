Data are accruing to support the impact of boosters for reducing Delta breakthrough infections

Here in San Diego all COVID hospitalizations are tracked by vaccination status, and the Delta wave is properly partitioned. These odds look pretty good for how to avoid a hospitalization from the Delta strain @SDCountyHHSA

Having already surpassed its pandemic peak of cases and hospitalizations, Mississippi's current trajectory is verticalâ€”unbridled spread. The state's leadership has no effective plan to deal with it. This is America.

Why hasn't Israel had a Delta wave U-turn like the UK?  Possible explanations:
â€”It's a month behind
â€”Both countries high % fully vaccinated but Israel achieved very early; waning immunity w/ Delta 
â€”Vaccine dose spacing 3 wks is inferior to 8-12 wks for a durable immune response

What vaccination strategies lead to the highest level of neutralizing Ab, immune response, in rank order?
1. Prior covid + mRNA 1-dose
2. Adenoviral-vector vaccine 1st dose, mRNA 2nd dose
3. 2 doses mRNA
4. 2 doses adenoviral vector (AZ data)

The problem we have is that there are more Americans with antibodies to vaccines, masks, distancing, ventilation, and best practices than vaccinated people with neutralizing antibodies to the ðŸ¦ .
