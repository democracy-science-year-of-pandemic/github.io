The illusion of tracking together
It appears that the US and Israel's case curves are superimposed.  But their testing per day is far (5.5X) apart

A marked reduction in testing likely explainer for a ~2:1 ratio for US cases: hospitalizations
Peak 3rd wave: 250,000 cases/7d avg; 125,000 hospitalizations, &gt; 2M tests/day
Current 4th wave: 110,000 cases/7d avg; 63,000 hospitalizations , ~1M tests/day

Reassuring. Current data from San Diego County, California's 2nd largest, which tracks vaccinated status and vaccine for new cases, ~58% total population vaccinated (national 50%).

But March -&gt; June are before Delta

This should be the norm, supplying high quality masks free charge to all who choose to use them, to help reduce the Delta wave hit https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1424458131434655746

There are 2 levels to flying blind in the Delta wave.
One is the CDC's void of data ðŸ‘‡
The other is our testing, &lt;&lt; 1/2 of 3rd wave, w/
very poor availability 
A no show: home rapid antigen tests, which should be freely provided to every household to help safely open schools https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1423726051474108417

RT @kallmemeg: America does not have a national health service. 

If they did, Iâ€™ve no doubt they would be tracking the #COVID19 pandemic bâ€¦

RT @FinchTH: @EricTopol And Botswana wouldnâ€™t be #2 on that list if it had access to vaccines to the same degree LA and FL do.

A picture that denotes the absence of a national strategy, of states rolling on their own, with leaders unwilling to adopt best practices for defending vs Delta, and which puts the whole country in jeopardy of further spread
