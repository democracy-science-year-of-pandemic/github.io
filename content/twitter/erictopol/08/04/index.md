The FDA full approval of vaccines in now expected by Labor Day; it took months to get transparency and communication w/ the public
https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/02/coronavirus-vaccines-fda-full-approval-timeline/
This Q&amp;A shows the prior lack of understanding of its urgency; also the implications on boosters

Summary Delta breakthrough studies, Ct/viral load,  vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
Only 1 large study of Ct/viral load, shows some vaccine reduction 
VE ranges 39-88%; it's likely â‰¤ 60% at best for mRNA
More data needed, but points to need for boosters for at least some people

There's little good news for the US Delta wave, but we may be seeing the peak case growth rate for the top 2 states, Louisiana and Florida

In the pandemic, immunocompromised people (~3% of Americans) are not getting adequate recognition for the potential of in-host evolution of the virus (highlighted studies) and the need for far better approaches to protect them https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2104756?query=featured_home @NEJM

Notable: several countries with Delta waves had abrupt U-turns that were short-lived or are stuttering

During the 3rd wave in the USA, cases got above 300,000 per day and deaths above 4,000.
In the 4th, Delta wave, cases have already reached ~150,000 in a day, with deaths  ~400 (7-day avg)
[and yes, there's a lag; hospitalizations and #LongCovid are a big deal in this wave]

There really are 2 lines, not 1, for the US and Israel 4th wave ascents.
Israel is quickly getting people age &gt;60 with booster shots, 11% in 3 days; it'll be important to watch for impact in the weeks ahead

The @Newsweek magazine must be getting desperate for sales to go with this cover. Delta is bad enough; there's no clinical evidence that Delta "Plus" or Lambda provide competition with it. Let's not make bad matters worse and beat this *&amp;^%'inðŸ¦
