The US has 59% of its population fully vaccinated. That's the same rate as 4 countries in Europe, currently with some of the highest fatality rates in the world.

The United States is not taking its 5th major wave seriously.
In November, new cases have increased 30% starting from the high level of 70,000/day. With that hospitalizations and deaths are increasing again.
We haven't taken heed from Europe 4 times
