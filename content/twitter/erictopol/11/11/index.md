Israel provided the initial and solid body of data that  booster shots restored effectiveness and helped achieve its turnaround. Now the UK adds to that

Just published @NatureMedicine 
An in-depth analysis of the 25 children who died from Covid in England during the 1st year of the pandemic
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01578-1
Great that 99.995% of children w/ a positive test survived (not what is driving the need for ðŸ’‰in kids)

The @nytimes published "What We Know So Far About
Waning Vaccine Effectiveness" today 
It is misleading and missing key reports from New York State, Veterans Affairs, Puerto Rico, Israel, Qatar, the UK, and several others

A year ago, Nov 9th, the 1st Covid vaccine was announced w/ &gt;90% efficacy vs symptomatic infections, at 2 months follow-up, before the emergence Î±, Î²,Î³ and Î´ variants
Today, w/ a 3rd shot, there's still &gt;90% efficacy vs Delta and risk of hospitalizations and deaths.
We're lucky.

RT @florian_krammer: @EricTopol @nytimes Yeah, its missing data from about 40 studies.

People with Prior Covid "have pronounced deficiencies in functional Spike-specific T cell responses and the ability to neutralize [with antibodies] the current variants of concern"

There's false assurance on "natural immunity" protection; it's not enough.

Germany has outperformed the US throughout the pandemic. It also has ~10% more of its total population fully vaccinated, and ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰more recently.
Today Germany had a pandemic record of new cases, nearly 50,000, and highest deaths (220) since May.

Not a good look for the US.

Oh, cases are "nonsensical"
Even though cases beget cases, beget #LongCovid, were the primary endpoint of efficacy for all vaccination trials, and have tracked with hospitalizations and deaths for every wave and recovery phase of the US pandemic https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/1458947883613437957
