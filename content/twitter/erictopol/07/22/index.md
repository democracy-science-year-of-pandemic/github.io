Sickening to read about places with less than half their health care workers vaccinated. WTF?

By the time @US_FDA comes through with full vaccine approval, we'll already be past the Delta wave (if this  @POTUS projection is accurate). 
Had this been done by June, millions of more Americans would have gotten vaccinated &amp; protected

Not a good sign when the 3rd most populous state, at 80% Delta, is showing a substantial rise in cases and hospitalizations with 48% fully vaccinated (just below national avg 49%)
https://newsnodes.com/us_state/FL
More testing done, but doesn't account for the spike in hospitalizations

A new report from India showing how rapid antigen tests can be exceptionally helpful in managing the pandemic when used at scale. 
And they should be made freely available, used now at scale in the US to help manage Delta, but where are they? https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009126 @PLOSCompBiol

With 67% of their residents fully vaccinated, highest in the US, Vermont continues to show Delta can be contained and hospitalizations can actually decrease....the only state in the US that has done that
https://newsnodes.com/us_state/VT
(What if the US had 67% instead of 49% fully vexed?)
