How #SARSCoV2 gets into our cells and Delta's enhanced capability involving its altered furin cleavage site, P681R mutation, and yet to be fully defined mechanism for its very high transmissibility

Just published @nature
Soon (10-12 days) after 1st dose of an mRNA vaccine, fully functional CD8+ T cells kick in to provide some protection, well before neutralizing antibodies are barely detectable https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03841-4

We used to refer to a "blockbuster" product of a pharmaceutical company as having $1 billion of sales in a year. Pfizer's vaccine take for 2021 is $33 billion

This quickly reaching 80 cases/100,000 residents in Louisiana, now exceeding its pandemic peak, and heading due North, is deeply concerning
Arkansas slowing, hope it continues

This new data from @pfizer on booster shots for increasing levels of neutralizing antibodies by age group in 23 people is not enough to make any call yet. We need to see clinical data to know whether this marker translates to need, and in whom

Delta didn't "erupt" here. Its growth followed an exponential curve, doubling every ~10 days over many weeks since April, and we could precisely predict its dominance and now ~94%

I deleted my prior post about the UK cases today which was simply noting the new data point and to keep an eye on this, nothing else, and with hope that the important U-turn keeps going.

Best US vaccination day reported in many weeks with 500,000 newbies and &gt;750,000 total doses, well above current average üëç
A silver lining of Delta along with the new movement towards vaccination requirements by many large entities

Very important @NEJM paper today on breakthrough infections (BTI) post-vaccination in Israeli health care workers. 
5 key points:
1. Of ~1500 people, 0.4% had BIs, sequenced to be Alpha 85% (this was pre-Delta)

Texas, signing onto the Delta wave, with 13,000 new cases today and &gt;80% increase in hospitalizations over the past 2 weeks.
US overall  &gt;63,000/day 7-day average will rise quickly when FL and TX get going like this

US Covid hospitalizations have shot up to &gt;42,000 today, almost 3X in the month of July, due to Delta infections in nearly all, and the lack of shots, in some states, as high as 98% of admissions are among unvaccinated people.
A D√©j√† Vu that was so utterly preventable.
