The rise in Delta to dominance happened at different times, but the impact on exponential case rise (by slope) is remarkably similar

That some fully vaccinated people are getting hospitalized is being used to undermine that #VaccinesWork. 
That's not true. 
My simple graphic below and straightforward math ðŸ§µfrom UK to show 90% preserved effectiveness (an underestimate)

The pandemic case peak for the UK was 62,596 in January. 
Today: 46,558. Let's hope this is at or close to peak and for a rapid descent

How to counter the US exponential rise of Delta to &gt;80% of cases is to stop the denominator of cases, the vicious loop, which drives everything. How to do that: vaccinations, masks and all the things we know work and aren't doing enough of them

Just published @ScienceMagazine 
Discovery of masitinib, from a library of 1,900 drugs, with potent anti-replication activity against #SARSCoV2 (via 3CLpro) and its major variants, and can be given as a pill @justsaysinmice

Quite a contrast
&gt;90% Delta in Arkansas &amp; Vermont http://covariants.org
Arkansas, 35% fully vaccinated, highest [36] cases/100,000  in the US, rising hospitalization (H) &amp; deaths
Vermont, 67% vaccinated, also seeing case growth to just 2/100K (near lowest) and *less* H

I miss @COVID19Tracking which provided same day, accurate covid hospitalizations and has not been taken up @CDCgov, as expected. We need this critical data now to follow Delta. Today &gt;27,000, a substantial rise from 15K nadir; we've still got a ways to go to get thru this wave

It has been over 7 months since the US vaccination campaign began. Yet TV and newspaper articles incessantly show people getting needles into their arms. I think we know what that looks like now. Enough
