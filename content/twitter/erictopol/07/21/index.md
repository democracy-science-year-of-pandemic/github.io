Proxy for vax efficacy?
"A neut [neutralizing antibody] level that keeps us safe from Alpha wonâ€™t necessarily thwart Beta or Delta to the same extent. (Thereâ€™s at least good news on T cells, which are much harder to stump with mutations)"

The relative values don't convey the remarkable vaccine impact here and in UK, Portugal w/ higher, longer Delta hit ðŸ‘‡

Good thread on some of the data we've been hearing about (but not seeing) on the potential of "waning immunity" for people who got vaccinated early in the Israeli campaign. They also happened to be the most vulnerable. 
Still many uncertainties. https://twitter.com/Nadav_Eyal/status/1417923435737534467

This advisory should be issued well beyond New Orleans. Like the US. https://www.ft.com/content/0494876b-6be8-4d42-8d1c-d4be8a955caa @FT
