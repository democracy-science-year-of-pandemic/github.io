https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/09/12/1036356773/i-got-a-mild-breakthrough-case-heres-what-i-wish-id-known @NPR @NPRHealth by @WStoneReports 
"The reality is breakthrough cases are becoming more common. Here's what you should know about getting a breakthrough case—and what I wish I'd known, when those 1st symptoms laid me low."

All these countries have been hit by Delta. Only 1 stands out 2-50X over the others and is currently the highest per capita in the world @OurWorldInData

There are 9 countries with ≥ 75% of their total population vaccinated. 
That's associated with very low or declining fatalities and new cases, and, where available, very low hospitalizations

There are likely less than 10,000 patients in US hospitals now who were fully vaccinated but sick with covid. Is it really too much to ask what vaccine they received, when vaxxed, their age and co-existing medical conditions?

The 2021 Sturgis Rally was a month ago. Perhaps it's a coincidence for the 2 states that are leading the country in rise of hospitalizations over the past 2 weeks.

RT @mike_hogan: Having had a breakthrough case, I  found this article more realistic than most. Some key points: lots of breakthrough cases…

Different patterns of descent after a Delta wave
—None have come back to baseline
—Some are heading back up
(the original notion of a full, quick descent seems to be, for the most part, an illusion)

The US had a chance to lead the world in vaccination.
At the rate it's going, the world will eventually surpass the US.

People are still writing that Israel (as a first mover) has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.
No, it ranks 24th. 
It is behind the leaders by 20 per cent points. And it's one of the reasons its Delta wave has been so troubling.

New definition of “rock of Gibraltar”
The place where &gt;99% of its population has been fully vaccinated.
